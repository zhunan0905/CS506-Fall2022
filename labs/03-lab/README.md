# cs506

We are re-using the python package defined in lab 2.

## Setup

Same as lab 2 + move all the code you wrote in lab 2 here.

## Goal

Take a look at the library functions [here](https://github.com/gallettilance/CS506-Fall2022/blob/master/labs/03-lab/cs506/kmeans.py).

Remove the

```python
raise NotImplementedError()
```

line and replace it with code that does what the function should do. Test your implementation by running "tox". The goal is to get all tests to pass. Upload your implementations to github by creating a pull request.

## Bonus

It's a good idea to take a look at the tests defined [here](https://github.com/gallettilance/CS506-Fall2022/blob/master/labs/03-lab/tests/test_kmeans.py), and add a few tests of your own. Remember to use both positive and negative examples for testing.

Contributions are always welcome (and encouraged) to clarify existing documentation in this repository!
