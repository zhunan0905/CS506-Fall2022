# K Nearest Neighbors

## Part 1

Finish the KNN implementation by adding function for train and predict.

Create a new object of the class KNN and test it on the iris dataset.

The following [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) may be helpful in uploading the dataset.

For this task, you may use library functions.

Split the data into 70:30 and use it for predictions

Plot a boxplot to visualize the data.

Predict the labels using KNN.

Use the Test function to calculate the accuracy.

Compute the error for 3 Neighbors. The error should be 0.02 or 2%.

Repeat for different values of Neighbors.


## Part 2

Make the distance function configurable. You may re-use the distance functions you implemented in the 02-lab.
